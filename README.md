#VR Movement Demo
This demo focuses on creating an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment using WebXR technologies where users can move around using controllers, and explore a 3D scene rendered space using Three.js.

Overview
The project is divided into three main components:

scene.js: Manages the rendering of the 3D scene, including setting up the camera, lights, objects, and controls.
gamepad.js: Handles input from VR controllers, dispatches events for button presses and axis movements, and manages locomotion and orientation in the scene.
controllers.js: Deals with the interactions with VR controllers, locomotion within the environment, orientation adjustments, and controller movements.


Key Features
Virtual Reality Environment: Users can immerse themselves in a virtual world using VR headsets.
Controller Interaction: Users can interact with objects and control their movement using VR controllers.
Object Rendering: Various 3D objects are rendered in the scene, enhancing the user experience.
Guideline and Cursor: Visual aids like a guideline, light, and target sprite assist users in navigation and interaction within the environment.


Code Structure
The project's codebase is organized as follows:

scene.js: Manages the 3D scene rendering and setup, including camera settings and object placements.
gamepad.js: Handles VR controller input, locomotion, and orientation adjustments within the scene.
controllers.js: Manages controller interactions, including event handling, movement calculations, and visual feedback.


Usage
Open the website in a compatible browser that supports WebXR.
Put on your VR headset and use the controllers to interact with the virtual environment.
Explore the 3D scene, move around, and engage with objects using the provided controller functionalities.


Dependencies
Three.js: A JavaScript library for creating and rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
WebXR API: Enables immersive VR experiences on the web, enhancing the project's capabilities.
